## All-Star Alliance Invitational at Kettering University

The last couple of weeks we have been practicing with our alliance partners 4635 Botbusters, 3478 Lambot and also our friends from 6017 Cyberius and 6647 Voltec have been helping us practice with defense as the opposing alliance members. We are exited to meet all the teams and alliances that will be attending the event and hope to have a great time.

## Software updates

While the mechanics teams has been busy assembling the robot upgrades. Software team has been working on converting our library/base code to use it like a vendor library, while the code is still majorly written for our own bots, we will be working during this offseason to separate the code from our robots so it is more robot/team agnostic. While it will only be available to use with C++, we still want to keep it open for everyone to see or use if they want so here is the URL:

[https://overture-7421.github.io/overturelib/OvertureLib.json](https://overture-7421.github.io/overturelib/OvertureLib.json)

Also our repo with the source code:

https://github.com/Overture-7421/overturelib

Also we will be migrating our simulation from ROS to Webots. The decision was made because our ROS system could be only run on Linux computers and most of our members are not really familiar with ROS. So with the hopes that almost every member could run the simulation on their computer if needed, the will be archiving our ROS system.

Here are the links to our Simulation Repositories:

We are also planning to migrate our autonomous paths to choreo but keep the Path Planner autonomous files, this is still in progress as we did not have time to test it before our next offseason.

NOTE: Donâ€™t apply hot glue directly to your new note detection camera and then remove it, probably wont end well.

## Robot upgrades

All the robot upgrades have been installed. The last couple of weeks we have testing our new front frame design and so far it has been holding up. We took advantage of the practice with our AllStar alliance partners and our friends from 6017 and 6647 to really test the frame and up until now it seems like it is really good at taking impacts. We are still taking some PC and extrusion replacements in case it breaks. Also some how the robot ended up around 5 pounds lighter.

Also we were able to try out our new upgrades and we found out that most of the upgrades are working great for the exception of the intake. We found out that while the only two rollers it had worked well, the note could not go up to the storage and would end up stuck inside the intake. We ended up adding two extra dead axle rollers to drive up the note so it got into the storage. It ended up working a lot better than we expected.
