## Impact resistant frame

Last Friday we tested a little of the new frame we have been working on. The intake plates were not completely secured and the rollers were not attached so the test still not really showed us a lot. Hopefully during the week we will be able to finish building the robot so maybe by next week we could do a full robot test to check if it really works.

After some more analysis we decided to make a small change in the new frame. The Polycarbonate thatâ€™s inside the frame extrusion does not extend through the whole part, so we plan on cutting a new piece to pass it through the whole frame to better distribute the forces when hit.

Also the parts that were missing to finish the robot finally arrived over the weekend, so we hope to finish building the robot this week.
