## It’s Alive (For real this time)

Intake and storage changes are finally done and software team has been working on characterizing the mechanisms and swerve the last couple of days. Mechanically we are just working on some weight reduction on our intake.

Most of our code seems to be working correctly and we are just working on fine tuning shooting while moving and some interpolation tables.

Here are some videos of some robot testing and tuning, the final code should allow the robot to be faster than what’s shown in the current videos.
