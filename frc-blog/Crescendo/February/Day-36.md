## Intake

While part of the team was building the new storage/shooter the rest of team was testing the competition intake. We were using compliance wheels and PETG spacers for intaking the notes. The wheels were compressing the note too much and the motor was stalling, also the wheels with spacers were vibrating a lot, so we decided to change the 2 bottom rollers to PVC rollers with grip tape with a 1.3 inch diameter. The new rollers fixed our compression issue and we are currently working on replacing the rest of the compliance wheels with different diameter PVCs to prevent any further issues.
