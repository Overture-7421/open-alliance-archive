## Auto testing

Yesterday we were able to test some of our autos. We recorded our 4 note auto which is around 8 seconds right now, the plan is to, hopefully, be able to expand it to a 6 note auto. For now the testing is being done without notes as we are waiting for them to arrive.

## Shoot While Move

Our shoot while moving code seems to be working, we are still waiting on the new notes to arrive tomorrow to finish tuning and calibrating the shooter. As you can see in the video the note is 60% wrapped in duct tape, which greatly affects its handling and indexing.

## 6 Note Auto (With out notes)

We were able to test then 6 note auto, without the notes. Hoping we will be able to test it with the notes tomorrow.
