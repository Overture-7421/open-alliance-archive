# Sunday Simulation updates

## Simulation and Vision

Our [simulation](https://github.com/Overture-7421/Overture-ROS) is almost completely ready to test our robot, we were able to incorporate mechanisms weight, reduction and other variables to be able to replicate as close as possible our robot behavior's, we could also get close enough PID and Motion Magic values for the motion of the mechanisms. Using our [OvertureLib](https://github.com/Overture-7421/InsertRobotName2024/tree/main/src/OvertureLib) and CTRE simulation capabilities we were able to incorporate simulation into our codebase with minimal changes to the CTRE devices wrappers we had.

Also managed to incorporate cameras with Photonvision on the simulator for April Tag detection with the full field on the sim. With all these additions we might be able to have a almost fully coded robot by the end of the month as we will be able to test autonomous and robot commands.
