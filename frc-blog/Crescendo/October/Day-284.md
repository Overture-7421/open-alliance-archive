# The Remix Recap

A late blog post about our time at The Remix Ofsseason!! Last month, we attended The Remix, hosted by FRC 1477 Texas Torque and FRC 7492 CavBots, along with some of our friends from Mexico. We finished qualifications ranked 2nd and were captains of the second alliance during playoffs. Our amazing alliance partners were teams 4635, 5829, and 10014. Unfortunately, we were eliminated in Match 13 of the semifinals. It was a fantastic experience meeting new teams and reconnecting with old friends from last year's event. We're looking forward to attending again next year!"

## Fails and Improvements

1. We had some issues with our trap sequence, which caused the robot to not align with the stage correctly.

**The Fix:** We will be replacing pathplanner PathFindToPose with our custom SpeedHelper implementation.

2. Our auto align was not working as expected in auto and the robot ended up not following the paths correctly.

**The Fix:** We will be implementing our auto align command with field relative capabilities so the the robot ignores PathPlanner when it detects a note.

## What We Learned

- The hybrid frame is still holding up well, it doesn't seem to have any issues yet so we will be keeping it for the our last offseason event.

## What's Next

- We will be attending our last offseason event in November, the Mexico All-Star Offseason.
- There will be one more blog post after the Mexico All-Star Offseason to wrap up the season.
- We will be continuing to post on a new Build Blog dedicated to our FTC teams 23619 and 26381.
- The FRC Build Blog will be back in January 2025 for the 2025 season.
