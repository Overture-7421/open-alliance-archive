# <span style="color:#6b35aa">Ready for 2025?</span>
We are back and ready for the 2025 season and our second year build blog! We have been working on a lot of stuff since the end of the 2024 season and we are excited to share it with you all.

## <span style="color:#6b35aa">Hosting a Kickoff Event</span>
We are excited to announce that we will be hosting our local kickoff event for the first time this year. We will be hosting the event at our high school and will be inviting all the teams in our region to come and watch the kickoff stream together.

### <span style="color:#6b35aa">Swerve Base</span>
After disassembling our 2024 robot, we decided to keep our 2024 drive base for prototyping and practice during the first weeks of the season.

### <span style="color:#6b35aa">Software</span>
Our codebase/library, OvertureLib, has been updated to the 2025 beta WPILib, but most importanly it has been ported to java. While we are not going to use java this season we decided to port it to java to start testing out AdvantageKit and also see if we can simplify the transition from FTC to FRC for our students as they use Java in FTC.

## <span style="color:#6b35aa">Mexico Open Alliance Blog</span>
If having two build blogs was not enough, we have decided to start a blog for our Mexico Open Alliance. So what is the Mexico Open Alliance? The Mexico Open Alliance Build Blog is a innitiative that we have started to help other teams in Mexico to have a place to share their progress and ask for help. We are excited to see how this project evolves and how it helps the Mexican FRC community.
