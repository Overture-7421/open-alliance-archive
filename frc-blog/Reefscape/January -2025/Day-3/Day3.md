# <span style="color:#6b35aa">Field Visualization</span>

While some of the students have been on working on finalizing the Whats and Hows of what we expect our robot to be. We took some time to get a sense of the field dimensions and check the height difference from the L4 and the net. We expect to start building our field soon, meanwhile we will be using AdvantageScope XR to get a sense of it.

So what did we get from this small test:

- If you can score in L4 you can probrably get the ball in the Net with the same mechanism.

- Single Mechanism for both Gampieces?? (Not convinced about this)

- An elevator than can reach L4 could accomplish every (game piece) task. (We need to prototype to be sure about this one)

We have begun building our field, hope to get it done by wednesday end of day.
