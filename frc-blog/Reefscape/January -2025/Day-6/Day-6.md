## <span style="color:#6b35aa">Coral Intake</span>

We were able to test a intake prototype with different compression and wheels configiration.

## <span style="color:#6b35aa">Algae Intake/Shooter?</span>

For lgae we decided to prototpe a intake that could also maybe shoot, but we are still doubtful of how big we should make it.

## <span style="color:#6b35aa">What we learned from these test</span>

- Not a lot of compression is needed with coral.
- Need grippy wheels/rollers.
- Algae requires a lot of space to be able to be launched.
- Algae cam be "pinched".
- Horizontal intake requires less precision.
- Will probably need to rotate the intake 90 degrees to score.

With this prototype we found out a couple of things.

- The wheels at high speeds bounce the coral out.
- If the coral goes down with a some force the wheels do not need to be turned on.
- Seems that only the big wheels need to be spinning.
- One row of compliant wheels and another of rigid seems to help.
- We can kinda dunk the coral for faster scoring.
