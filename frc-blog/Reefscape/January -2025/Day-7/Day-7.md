- 2 Stage Elevator
- Single Jointed Arm
- Rotary Writst

## <span style="color:#6b35aa">Coral Intake</span>

Yesterday we found a configuration and size we liked for our Coral intake/scorer. We focused on it being caple of intaking mainly from the source and on a lower priority ground intake. Also when scoring we will be "Dunking" the coral instead of throwing it with wheels to increase precision

## <span style="color:#6b35aa">Algae Testing</span>

After finding out the configuration of the Coral intake we wanted to test if we could use the same wheels for Algae intaking. We want to test if it would be possible to open and close the intake to be able to use the same mechanism.
