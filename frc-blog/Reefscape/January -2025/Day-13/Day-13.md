After a couple of days of discussing the final details of the design we have finally begun working on the CAD. Here are the links:

(Some of the onshape documents are still empty as we are still working on them)

Some major changes from last post:

- Chassis ended up being a 24x22 inch rectangle.
- Our climber design has been changed to look more like the robonauts everybot climber.
- Dual purpose game piece intake.
- Low rider chassis to keep the center of gravity low.
- Heavy bellypan.
- Reduced intake width.

Last draft of the robot before we started with the official CAD is shown below:
