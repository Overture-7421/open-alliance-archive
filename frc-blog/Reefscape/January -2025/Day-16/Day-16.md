# <span style="color:#6b35aa">CAD Update</span>

A couple of days ago we posted our CAD links but we have not been updating them that much. The main reason of this is due to us using a Draft CAD to finalize some details before we move to the main CAD. Why did we do this? We wanted to keep the main CAD clean and organized due to the amount of drastic changes our robot has gone through.

Here are the links to the drafts in order:

- Draft 1
  - [Idea 1](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/4bbffdf1453b17732b9924b6/w/5758dd097d4873d58e665517/e/8677a01d4035c321ac87ed88?renderMode=0&uiState=678db3782451d1401c00d639)

## <span style="color:#6b35aa">Some major changes</span>

This week we realized that the location of our climber of our robot would not work due to the center of mass being too much to the side.

So what are some of the changes we made?

- We went back to the 24" x 24" frame due to packagin issues (Would not recommend)
- Changed the location of the climber from the back of the robot to the side due to the elevator being sideways.
- Everybot style climber without a winch.

## <span style="color:#6b35aa">Current Main CAD</span>

Like we mentioned before we have been finalizing some details on the draft CAD. We should have our main CAD done by the end of tomorrow. Will update the thread when is done.
