## <b><span style="color:#6b35aa">Simulation</span></b>

As we are a little begind on our build schedule the software team has been working on the simulation to make sure that most of the logic and code is ready for the robot and that we only need to fine tune it.

## <b><span style="color:#6b35aa">Autonomous Testing</span></b>

We have been taking advantage of the simulation and have begun testing our autonomous code. The timing of the autonomous is a little jankey but is giving us a good idea of what we need to do.
