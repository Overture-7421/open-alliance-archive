# <span style="color:#6b35aa">Climber Redesign</span>

Following up on the climber redesign, we have updated the Main and Climber CAD to reflect the changes. The new designs seems to integrate better with the rest of the robot, gives us more space to work with while climbing and allows us for better access to electrical components.

Most of the CAD is done, we are just doing some final details and making sure everything fits together. We expect to start building the robot Monday or Tuesday next week. Will probably take a couple of weeks to get it completly build and wired as we will be waiting on a few parts to arrive.
