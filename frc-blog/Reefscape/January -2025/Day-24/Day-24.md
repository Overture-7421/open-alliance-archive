# <span style="color:#6b35aa">Intake Redesign</span>

After testing the intake, we realized that the intake was not going to hold the Algae in place with only gas shocks or springs. We decided to add a motor to the intake to help keep the algae in place, we found out that this will also help us score our coral faster. We have updated the CAD to reflect the changes (Still a work in progress).
