## <b><span style="color:#6b35aa">3d Printed Swerve Wheels</span></b>

After reading <a href="https://www.chiefdelphi.com/t/wildstang-robotics-program-team-111-and-112-build-blog-2025/477716/36"><span style="color:#6b35aa">WildStang wheels post</span></a>, we decided we wanted to try 3d printed thread with the SDS billet wheel for our swerve drive. We had a few reasons for this:

- Colson wheels are expensive and we wanted to try a cheaper alternative.
- Wanted to improve the grip of the swerve drive for better odometry.
- We only used one set of Colson wheels last year and by the time we went to worlds they were almost gone (still used them though).
- While using the black neoprene is a good alternative, it was still expensive for us as an international team.
- Wanted to have replacements in case we needed them.

## <b><span style="color:#6b35aa">How we printed the wheels</span></b>

So how did we printed the wheels? We used the following:

- Ender 3 S1 Pro
- Ultimaker Cura for the slicer
- SainSmart Purple TPU filament
- Wheels at 100% infill
- 235 degrees for the nozzle
