We tested a dual purpose intake prototype, inspired by Team Scream 4522, that can intake both coral and algae. While it could actually intake both game pieces, we found that it could not hold Coral well enough to be effective. We will probably go ahead with a similar design but with motors that will open and close the intake to switch between Coral and Algae.
