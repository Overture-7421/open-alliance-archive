# <b><span style="color:#6b35aa">Championship Recap</span></b>

</div>
After a couple of months without posting, here is our recap of the 2025 FIRST Championship! We competed in the Hopper Division and ended with a 3-7-0 record, placing 71st overall. We didn’t make it to playoffs, but we still had a great time playing against some of the best teams out there. We learned a lot and are excited to apply those lessons to our offseason work.

This post is going to be a bit different from our usual competition recaps, we’re keeping it short and saving our thoughts for a future post. Our offseason robot is already in the works. So stay tuned for the next post where we’ll break down what we’ve been working on.

While we did not get the results we hoped for, we did manage to get some laughs out of it. We ended getting [ stuck on the barge](https://www.chiefdelphi.com/t/reefscape-secret-endgame-tracking-thread/493822/54) during a match, which caused us to climb the barge. We are actually surprised that the elevator was able to hold the weight of the robot. We ended up getting a good picture of it.
