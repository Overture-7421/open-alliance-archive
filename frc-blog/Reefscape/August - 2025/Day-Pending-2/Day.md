# <span style="color:#6b35aa">Daytona 2.0</span>

Over the past month, we have been working on our offseason robot. After looking at our previous designs and identifying areas for improvement, we decided to take advantage of all the completed build thread and tech binder releases for Daytona 2.0.

Due to budget and time constraints, we decided to keep our chassis and elevator designs, with a couple of modifications, so we started to look for robot architecture that would fit our needs and would not require a complete redesign. We ended up going for [Team 1778 - Chill Out's](https://www.thebluealliance.com/team/1778) robot as an inspiration.

Here are the CAD links for Daytona 2.0:

There are some details that still need to be worked out, but we are making good progress. Here are some images of the current robot design:
