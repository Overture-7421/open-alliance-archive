After a one and a half week without posting, we are back with our last update before competition. Will not be a long post as we are writing this right before the gates open at our week 1 regional.

## <b><span style="color:#6b35aa">Weight Reduction</span></b>

After trying to reduce the weight of the robot we ended up removing the climber as we were almost 15 pounds over the weight limit. We also changed some aluminum parts to Polycarbonate and 3D printed parts. We hope to add the climber back for our second competition at Heartland Regional.
