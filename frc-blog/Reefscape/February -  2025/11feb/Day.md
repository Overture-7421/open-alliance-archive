## <b><span style="color:#6b35aa">Robot Assembly</span></b>

</div>
After our weekend FTC competition, we are back on assembling the robot. We have a few more parts to add (like the intake/scoring mechanism).

## <b><span style="color:#6b35aa">Wiring</span></b>

We have also started wiring the chassis and hope to continue wiring after the mechanical team finishes assembling the robot.

So far we have wired some of the chassis motors with the WCP Power Pole adapter to connect the CANCoders directly to the TalonFX to reduce the amount of wiring needed.

### <b><span style="color:#6b35aa">Next Steps:</span></b>

- Add the intake/scoring mechanism.
- Focus on weight reduction.
- Wire the robot.
- Print the 3D parts for camera mount and other accessories.
- Test the robot.
- Fine tune mechanisms and autos

## <b><span style="color:#6b35aa">Robot Weight</span></b>

</div>

While the robot is still not ready we decided to weight it to get an idea on how much we need to reduce.

</div>

And we definitely need to reduce some weight as there are still some important things to note that we still need to do:

Add:

- Bolts
- Electronics
- Wiring
- Some 3D printed parts

Remove:

- The excess SplineXl from the intake

### <b><span style="color:#6b35aa">Next Steps:</span></b>

1. Finish the robot assembly.
2. Finish the wiring.
3. Test the robot and tune the mechanisms.
4. Check the center of mass of the robot to see if it tips
5. Determine which aluminum parts can be replaced with Polycarbonate.
6. Determine where we can reduce the weight by taking out material without affecting the robot's stability.

### <b><span style="color:#6b35aa">How are we going to decide?</span></b>

We are currently think of two options:

1. If we find out that the robot is not tippy we might reduce weight from the bellypan.
2. If the robot is tippy we might reduce weight from the elevator stages.
