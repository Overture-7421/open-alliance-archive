## <b><span style="color:#6b35aa">Build Progress</span></b>

For the last couple of days, we have been working on building the robot, we are still bedind on our schedule but we are making progress. Hopefully, we will be able to catch up soon as we compete in a Week 1 event.

### <b><span style="color:#6b35aa">Chassis</span></b>

Our competition chassis is almost complete, we have begun adding our elevator base to it and are working on the elevator. We modified the chassis to be a low rider to help with the center of gravity.
