Over the last week we have been working on getting our Auto Align working to get more consistent autonomous and we managed to get a pretty consistent 3 Coral auto. More detailed post on our Auto Align coming soon!

(We scored on the same spot twice due to our reef having broken branches, but we just need to change the command from right to left and it will be good to go!)
