# Overtureâ€™s Software and Electrical Training Resources

---

> ðŸ’¡ The training here is mandatory for every member of the Software and Electrical sub-team. Every member should complete the whole training course including both FTC and FRC content as everyone should be able to participate in both categories.
>
> Resouces included here are a mixture of presentations given by mentors and self-study resources that will include external resources and videos. The order of completion is important as some resources will build on the knowledge of previous resources.

## 1. Submitting Proof of Completion

Depending on the resource, you may be required to submit proof of completion.

For presentations given by mentors, you will be required to register your assitance after the presentation.

For external resources, you will be required to submit a screenshot of the completion certificate or a summary of the resource.

For excersises, you will be required to review the excersise with a mentor so he can verify your completion and understanding of the excersise.

## 2. Order of Completion

Complete the courses in the order listed below.
