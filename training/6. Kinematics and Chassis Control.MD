# Chassis Control using Kinematics
1. Do your own research (WPILib Docs) on the following topics:
    - Kinematics
    - Differences between Inverse and Forward Kinematics
2. Make sure you understand the difference between inverse and forward kinematics, and what their uses are.
3. Use the DriveKinematics available from WPILib to control your robot chassis, use the classes you created in the previous exercise to control the motors.
4. Limit the acceleration of your chassis using a SlewRateLimiter from WPILib
5. Report your progress to a mentor to verify your completion.
