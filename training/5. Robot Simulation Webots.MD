# Robot Simulation using Webots
1. Download Webots Simulator: https://cyberbotics.com/
2. Clone our Webots Workspace: https://github.com/Overture-7421/Overture-Webots.git
3. Download the appropiate project for you to work on:
    - FRC: WPILib Robot Project with Desktop Support Enabled
    - FTC: https://github.com/Overture-7421/FtcRobotController-Sim.git

5. Do your own research (ChatGPT allowed, asking mentors too) on the following topics:
    - NetworkTables
    - NetworkTables interface to Webots Simulation (Ask the mentors or team members)
    - How to access Joystick data on your project

6. Create a class that is able to control a motor inside the simulation using NetworkTables
7. Link a motor to move on a button press from a Joystick
8. Link a motor to move at a different speed depending on a Joystick Axis
9. Make the chassis of your project driveable (Whether its FRC or FTC) using your Joystick
10. Report your progress to a mentor to verify your completion.
