# Practice basic inheritance and class compositions
2. Do your own research on the following topics:
	- Inheritance
    - Base Class (Sometimes called Super Class)
    - Derived Class


3. Implement 3 different Derived classes for the 3 People Exercise. Each one should add methods and members that are only relevant to a specific proffesion. (e.g. A new class that extends the base class so it works better for a Programmer, another for an Architect, etc.)
Each one should have unique elements to them that dont make sense on the other proffesions.

4. Do the same operations as in the "3 People Exercise" but only with 4 workers, one base one, and an instance of each of the classes you created. All of them should be added to the same vector/array.

4. Report your progress to a mentor to verify your completion.
