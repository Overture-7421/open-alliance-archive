# Sunday Update

## Trap Testing

We were finally able to test trap scoring to not so good results at first, the whole robot tipped over.

To fix the tipping we are adding back our support arms, but instead of using to lean against the stage the arms will provide support from under the stage.

## 6 Note Auto

We were able to do the 6 note auto, while the video shows it doing 7 notes in around 21 seconds we managed to get the 6 notes under 15 seconds. Currently donâ€™t have a video of the 6 notes under 15 but should get one this week while as we are still optimizing it this week.

We also decided to run the 7 notes as sometimes when it misses one note the robot has time to get to the 7th note and tries to shoot it.
