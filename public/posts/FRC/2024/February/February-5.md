# Monday Update

## Autonomous

This year we had a goal of having at least three consistent autos for our week 1, to achieve this we decided to keep using and taking advantage of all of PathPlannerâ€™s capabilities. On our week one post we briefly talked about our three base autos.

### 3 Note Wing Auto

For the first auto we are planning on at least scoring the 3 notes located on the wing, while also having an alternative that will be able to score 5 Notes, hopefully 6. The reason for having two version of the first auto is to be able have more adaptability with the alliances in qualifications. We are currently working on a shooting while moving code that should help achieve the 5 Note version of this auto.

### Left Side and Right Side Auto

For this two autos the plan is to shoot the preloaded note and go straigh for the centerline notes on each side. Both of them should be able to shoot 3 notes while leaving the one in the center alone. We hope that with some tunning we could make an alternate auto for both that also shoots the center note.
