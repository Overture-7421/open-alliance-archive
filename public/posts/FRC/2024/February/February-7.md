# Wednesday Small Update

We have just a small update today. Probably will be posting a working bot in a day or two.

## Robot

We are in the final stages of wiring and building our competition bot. Still waiting on some PETG spacers and PC adapters for our shooter to finish printing.

## Software

-   Still working on our base autos, we have yet to test them in simulation but should be almost ready to run on the real robot, we hope that we should only need to make some adjustments to PIDs and some positions to get them to the minimum acceptable version. Once the robot is ready we will start perfecting them as simulation can only take us so far.
-   Finished Shooting While Moving code, which seems to be working correctly on simulation we only need to adjust our interpolation tables and some PID values once we test it on the real bot.
-   Finished making semi-autonomous versions of most our scoring commands. Again simulation seems to work great and should only need minor values adjustment once in a non simulated environment.
-   We finally ordered a replacement camera, while we couldnâ€™t get a OV9281 replacement we got a AR0114 that should work fairly similar. While we wait for it to arrive we will be testing vision with the broken OV928, which seems to work some times.
