## Alpha Bot

Started building our alpha bot by attaching our intake prototype to our swerve drive base. The under-the-bumper intake, inspired by teams 95, 3847, and 4522, seems to be able to intake the notes at high speeds.

The CAD is almost finished and ready to be put into our simulator. We will be posting pictures of the CAD and videos of the simulation later today.

## **Field**

Finally, we finished building our field elements using leftover wood and polycarbonate for the Source, Amp, and Speaker. The Stage was built after buying the chain and some PVC pipes.

# Friday Updates Alpha Bot and Simulation

## Alpha Bot and Simulation

The software team finished importing the CAD of the Alpha Bot into the simulator and started testing it with some basic commands. We hope that by Monday, we can begin testing the autos in the simulator. We aim to finish building alpha version of the robot this weekend.

We didn’t have time to record videos of the simulation, but the robot has already been imported.

Here’s an image of our current concept, [Alpha Bot](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/7713014d9581fd5ca14c0274/w/367b9afcf469d7b155e49540/e/0bb998828847636219fa081d), It consists of an under-the-bumper intake and a shooter attached to a double-jointed arm. The climbing mechanism is still missing, but it should be done in a day or two.
