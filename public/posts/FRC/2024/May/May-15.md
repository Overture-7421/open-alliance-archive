## Results and ranking

### Qualification Days

The first day we ended up with a 1-4-0 record and ended up ranked on the last 10 of the division, but the second day and ended up with a 5-5-0 record wining 4 out of the 5 matches of the second day and ranking 43 in the division.

### Playoffs Day

We ranked 43th at the end of qualifications and got into playoffs as the 2nd pick of alliance #7. We also want to thank our amazing alliance partners 2521 - SERT, 4635 - Botbusters and 2485 - W.A.R. Lords. Our alliance ended up with a record of 2-2-0 in playoffs getting eliminated by the 8th alliance on Match 12.

### Awards

The team was awarded the Judges Award for the Curie Division! Marking the first time we got an award at champs.

## Fails and Improvements

During champs we did not have a lot of failures compared to regionals but we did end up having some pretty big and catastrophic failures.

1. The spline that moved the arm ended up becoming a circle and gave us a lot of backslash.

**The fix:** We will be replacing the spline during the summer as there was not enough time to replace it through champs. Also add a reinforcement 3D print.

2. Broken and bent intake frame 3 times during competition.

**The fix:** Replace it with spare frames we brought to champs. Will be definitely be looking to reinforce the most exposed parts of the robot.

3. SDS Module belt broke. We don’t if it was cause of wear and tear or an issue caused by how the robot was positioned on our cart.

**The fix:** Replaced the belt by disassembling most of the module.

4. Bumper gussets broke after some heavy impacts. The were made with 6 mm polycarbonate sheet.

**The fix:** Put in a spare one, but for the future they will be made from aluminum.

5. The bolts that attached the bumper to the frame ended up almost breaking and bent.

**The fix:** As they were inside the bumper they could not be replaced so we just force them back into shape as much as we should. Will be using bigger bolts next time.

## What we learned?

-   Spline do break and sometime need reinforcement when under a lot weight. (Climbing using the arm).
-   Don’t attach bearing directly to plates when that part is receiving impact as they might come out because of the force or if the the plate bends. We will be passing a bolt through the plate to fix the bearing in place for the future.
-   When printing gears for encoders don’t make the teeth too small, it might end up skipping steps. The arm ended up skipping steps and had offset of 3 degrees on eliminations which was enough to make the robot miss shots.

-   Side frames wont bent when adding a cross bar to distribute the energy.

-   **Reinforce the intake frame and have spares.**

## What you want to see next?

As other teams have done in their blogs we wanted to ask the teams that have seen our posts, what you liked, what you want us to post more about, what do you think we could improve? So basically any type of feedback is welcome!

## We will be back!

We will be taking a break from posting for now, but we will continue to post when we begin working on our offseason bot and projects.
