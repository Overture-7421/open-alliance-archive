## Main Upgrades Completed

Shooter and Intake upgrades have been assembled and tested. As we mentioned before the idea behind these upgrades was to get better functioning mechanisms without having to do a rebuild, the main concept of the mechanisms were not changed.

### Intake

- The intake works better now with two motors instead of one and managed to reduce intake friction by checking for the correct pulley distances.
- Replaced the worn out tennis racket grip with new padel racket grip.
- The plates were reduced in size but stayed almost the same weight as we took out the weight reduction to make less prone to bends.

### Shooter

- The new plates seem to give it more stability and reduced vibrations.
- Replaced the rev color sensor with a distance sensor for detecting the notes in the storage. We are planning to keep both sensors on the robot in case one breaks.
- Replaced the PVC and Tape rollers with green stealth wheels. Also decided to change the right side green wheels with the orange ones for increased friction to produce spin.
- The notes seem to stay more in the air enabling us to shoot from further away. Currently testing on wing line shooting for autos. Probably could shoot from behind the wing line but not planning on that to keep shots consistent.
- The upper wheels and lower wheels are no longer separate systems and are now powered by two mechanically connected falcons.

## Software upgrades

- New cameras were mounted and calibrated. Still need to test object detection for autos but we seem to get good and consistent data from photonvision. We are currently at 2 April Tags cameras and 1 for object detection, still need to test all of the three cameras working together in a single Orange Pi 5.
- New note detecting sensor is working, still needs some tuning but seems to be working great.

## Whatâ€™s next?

- Still need to fix trap mechanism.
- A lot of driver practice.
- Auto tuning and optimization.
- General testing.
