# All-Star Alliance Invitational at Kettering University

A little bit of a late post but here it is. About a month ago we attended the All-Star Alliance Invitational at Kettering University with our Mexican alliance partners Botbusters 4635 and Lambot 3478. We ended up ranking 7th after qualifications and got eliminated on Eighth-Finals after a tie-breaker match.

## Fails and Improvements

1. Our support arms were not staying in place during the matches causing them to stick out of the robot for a good part of matches. The support arms ended up getting hit and broken.

**The Fix:** Designed a new release mechanism to keep them from releasing on impact.

2. Our batteries were not lasting a whole match causing burnouts on the last 20-30 seconds and also got disconnected a couple of times.

**The Fix:** Applied some more current limits during competition, which did not really help, until a couple days ago we lowered rate of change of the acceleration in our Slew Rate Limiter to 2/3 of the original value.

3. Radio Power Module had a short/damaged which caused us to disconnect a couple of times.

**The Fix:** Replaced the Radio Power Module with another one and fix some cabling issues that could cause it to keep restarting.

## What we learned?

-   Our hybrid frame does indeed work and is better at receiving impacts than a pure aluminum frame. It did not break during the whole competition.
-   We need more practice against defense as the double feeder strategy is easily shut down.

## What next?

We are coming back to The Remix in Texas this year and some of our Mexican friends are coming along this year. We are excited to see all the amazing teams that are also coming back this year.
