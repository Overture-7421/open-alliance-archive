## Welcome to Overtureâ€™s 2024-2025 FTC build thread!
Overture is thrilled to join the FTC Open Alliance for the 2024 - 2025 season. We are excited to continue sharing our experiences with the rest of the FIRST community.

## A little about us
We are 23619 & 26381, a couple of FIRST Tech Challenge teams from Monterrey, Mexico. We started competing in the 2023-2014 season with our first FTC team, 23619, expanding from our [FRC Team 7421](https://www.chiefdelphi.com/t/overture-7421-build-blog-2024-open-alliance/446286) and this year we are opening a second team, 26381, to continue with our goal of spreading an interest in the field of science and technology within our team and our community

## How often will we be posting
Hopefully we will be updating the blog two times a week. As we started the blog some time into the season we will be probably posting more often as the blogs catches up with current time in our season

## With what tools do we work with
Like previous year we are continuing using OnShape and our CAD links will be updated on real time through the season.

As for software we will be posting the repositories as soon as they are created and available. We will be developing our code in Java and will be posting our FTC simulation and custom library soon as well.
