# Regional Winners!

![Team Photo](Day-59/Team%20Photo.jpeg)

We are proud to say we got our second winner blue banner this weekend at Monterrey Regional and also won the Industrial Design Award. We ended up on rank #2 after qualification matches and ended up as captains of the #2 alliance. Obviously we could not have won the event without our amazing alliance partners Roult 4403 and Buluk 3472.

## Some Highlights

**6 Note Auto**

The 6 note auto finally worked correctly on Match 13 on playoffs, after that it got pretty consistent.

We ran it again in the two finals and managed to get 5 notes scored as the other alliance got the 6 note first than us.

**Auto Races for center notes**

Not a very successful attempt due to intake pushing the notes but with some tunning the auto should be fixed.

## What we learned

-   Wheels are better than PVC with gaff tape, tennis racket grip and a lot of glue for shooting.
-   Multiple note autos get wins.
-   Trap is crucial for ranking.
-   Climbing is not a match decider in playoffs most of the time.
-   Amplifying is super important for wins, a robot that can score in amp and speaker fast is crucial for playoffs alliances.
-   A good defensive robot can help win a match.
-   Over the bumper intakes broke multiple times due to collisions.
-   Although we have very good drivers, they did not have a lot of practice time before the regional. Getting them a little bit more practice with the robot in its current state could help them be even better.

## Fails and Improvements

For almost all of our matches our robot was not at a 100% due to multiple issues that came up during play. We managed to almost all issues by the last semifinal.

1. New notes were not working with our shooter at first, as we built it around our single used note.
   **The Fix**: We added more compression to our PVC rollers using gaff tape and Pritt to add more friction between the notes and the tape.
2. Tennis grip tape works great for shooting but it tends to expand and detach from the PVC at high speeds, this stopped our shooter from working as it got it stuck on our antivibration supports.
   **The Fix:** Gaff tape with “Kola Loka” glue to keep it attached to the PVCs.
3. Through bore encode cable disconnected a couple times cause it collided with a chain tensor, this caused our arm to not move and we were unable to score.
   **The Fix:** Glue it for competition and move the chain tensor to a different position.
4. Hex Shaft from the shooter bent due to wrong pulley belt size causing the motor to stall and not reach velocity for shooting.
   **The Fix:** Replaced the hex shaft and changed the pulleys ratio to get the belt to have less tension.
5. Note was not getting in the trap because of the angle or the friction caused by the stage.
   **The Fix:** TBD
6. Shoot while move was not consistent although we believed this was caused by the previous issues on the list.
   **The Fix:** Should not need a fix if it got fixed by the solutions mentioned above. Need more testing to be 100% sure what the issue was
7. We got intake damage from some collisions. The side plates got bent due to not having rivets on the center of the play causing it to bend at the center. This also caused the front 2x1 extrusion to bend.
   **The Fix:** Flattened the plates again with a hammer and put rivets on the center of the plate. Also replaced the front 2x1 extrusion.

## What Worked

-   We got our 6 note auto working again in the playoffs which after fixing all the previously mentioned problems got pretty consistent and got us the event high score.
-   Our climbing was pretty consistent and fast.
-   Acceleration over top speed. We ended up changing our driving falcons with krakens due to some of them not working after multiple season use. We decided to try and get the current limit to a higher number to see if we could get faster autos, which allowed us to get a 6 note auto just under 15 seconds.
-   The double jointed arm seems to be pretty fast and consistent when aiming from different distances and scoring in the Amp.
-   LEDs are good for telling the drivers when they have a note on storage.

## What’s Next?

-   Shooter redesign to change PVC for wheels. (This change is intended for the championship)
-   7 Note Auto?
-   Amp and Source auto tuning for center line racing.
-   Bumper and front rail fix.
-   Driver Practice
